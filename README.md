# Agent Supervisor System

A system consisting of a supervisor agent and subordinate agents that connect to it for coordinated task execution.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Supervisor Agent**
   - Manages and coordinates multiple subordinate agents
   - Assigns tasks and monitors progress
   - Handles task prioritization and load balancing
   - Provides oversight and error handling

2. **Subordinate Agents**
   - Connect to the supervisor agent
   - Execute assigned tasks
   - Report progress and results
   - Handle specific domain tasks
